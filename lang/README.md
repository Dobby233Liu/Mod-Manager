## Guidelines for translating
1. If you're creating a new language file, make sure you use a language code from [here](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/locales). 
Anything else will be rejected.
2. Use [English (UK)](en-GB.json) as the basis for your translations.
3. Please don't use a machine translator to create translations.
4. If possible, avoid making your strings significantly longer or shorter than the original English.
